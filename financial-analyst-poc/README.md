## 🔍 Key Capabilities

- **Market overview dashboard**  
  Global indices, intraday sentiment (bullish/bearish), SPY trend, and a personalized watchlist for quick daily checks.

- **Stock analysis & comparison**  
  Single‑stock deep dives plus multi‑stock comparison with 1‑year relative performance charts and side‑by‑side fundamentals (P/E, ROE, margins, dividend yield, recommendations).

- **NAV / price‑drop alerting workflow**  
  LangGraph workflow that monitors price moves against user‑defined thresholds, classifies severity (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH), and hands off to n8n for email / chat alerts.

- **LLM‑powered research assistant**  
  Natural‑language interface (Groq / OpenAI) that can answer questions like  
  "Compare TCS and Infosys on 1‑year performance and valuation" or  
  "What's today's market sentiment and top losers in my watchlist?".

- **Beginner‑friendly design**  
  Built for new investors and junior analysts: simple UI, opinionable defaults, and clear visuals instead of complex trading terminals.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Frontend

- Streamlit single‑page app (`ui/streamlit_app.py`)
- Dark / light theme, sidebar navigation:
  - Dashboard
  - Stock Analysis
  - Charts (relative performance & fundamentals)
  - Alert Config

### Backend

- FastAPI service (`backend/`) exposing JSON REST APIs:
  - `POST /get_price` – price, returns, technical snapshot
  - `POST /get_news` – latest news for a ticker
  - `GET  /get_market_summary` – global indices snapshot
  - `POST /compare_stocks` – async multi‑ticker comparison
  - `POST /run_NAV_Alert_Trigger` – LangGraph alert workflow
  - `POST /chatbot_query` – LLM‑driven research Q&A entrypoint

### AI & Workflows

- **LangGraph** state machine for multi‑step logic (fetch → analyze → alert)
- **Groq / OpenAI** LLMs for intent detection, query understanding, and answer generation
- **n8n** workflow for external notifications (email / Slack etc.)

### Data Layer

- `yfinance` for real‑time and historical OHLCV data, fundamentals, and analyst recommendations
- Encapsulated helper utilities so providers can be swapped later without changing API contracts

## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amogh-aziro-18/financial-analyst-poc-.git
cd financial-analyst-poc
```

### 2. Create & activate virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv

# Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS / Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Configure environment variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_key_here
```

`.env` is ignored by Git so that secrets never leak.

## 🚀 Running the POC Locally

### 1. Start the backend (FastAPI)

```bash
uvicorn backend.app:app --reload --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8000
```

- Swagger / OpenAPI docs: `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`

### 2. Start the frontend (Streamlit)

Open a second terminal:

```bash
cd financial-analyst-poc
.\venv\Scripts\activate   # or source venv/bin/activate

streamlit run ui/streamlit_app.py
```

- UI: `http://localhost:8501`

## 🧭 How to Use

### 1. Dashboard

- View overall **market mood** (bullish / bearish) based on major indices
- See intraday moves for S&P 500, NASDAQ, Dow Jones, NIFTY 50 etc.
- Inspect SPY candlestick chart and your watchlist to see which names are moving

Use this as your **morning snapshot**: "What kind of market are we in today?"

---

### 2. Stock Analysis

- Enter a single ticker to get:
  - Current price, absolute and percentage move
  - Volume vs average, 52‑week high/low and distance from each
  - Recent daily history and returns
- Good for quick pre‑trade research on one company

---

### 3. Charts – Multi‑Stock Comparison

- Enter up to **5 tickers** (e.g., `AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, NVDA, TCS.NS`)
- The **Relative Performance (1 Year)** chart normalizes all to 0% and shows how each stock has performed over the last year
- Below, a **Fundamental Comparison** table shows:
  - Market cap, P/E ratio, profit margin, ROE
  - Dividend yield and analyst recommendation (buy / strong_buy, etc.)

This answers: **"If I invested in X vs Y a year ago, who won, and whose fundamentals look stronger today?"**

---

### 4. Alerts – NAV / Price Drop Trigger

- Choose a ticker and set a drop threshold (e.g., "Alert me if TCS drops more than 1% vs previous close")
- LangGraph workflow:
  1. Fetches current & previous close via `yfinance`
  2. Computes percentage drop
  3. Compares with user threshold
  4. Classifies severity (LOW / MEDIUM / HIGH)
  5. Returns a structured alert payload and optionally triggers n8n via webhook

This offloads simple risk monitoring so users do not need to stare at charts all day.

---

### 5. Chatbot (Optional / If Enabled)

- Ask questions like:
  - "Compare TCS and INFY on 1‑year performance and valuation."
  - "What's today's market sentiment and which watchlist stocks are down more than 2%?"
- The LLM:
  1. Parses intent and tickers
  2. Calls appropriate backend APIs
  3. Returns a concise, human‑readable answer

---

## 🧠 Design & Implementation Notes

- **Encapsulated data access**  
  All interactions with yfinance live in `yf_utils.py` and return a uniform structure `{success, data, error}` so endpoints and LangGraph nodes stay simple and robust.

- **LangGraph for workflows**  
  NAV/price‑drop alert is modelled as a state graph with pure nodes: `fetch → analyze → alert`. This makes business logic testable, observable, and easy to extend with new steps (e.g., logging, portfolio aggregation).

- **Async backend**  
  Comparison endpoints fetch multiple tickers in parallel using `asyncio`, significantly reducing latency when analysing a basket of symbols.

- **Beginner‑first UX**  
  Streamlit UI focuses on clean charts, simple text, and one‑click actions so that even users new to markets can benefit.

## 🧪 Possible Extensions

Ideas if you want to take this beyond a POC:

- News & social‑media sentiment for tracked tickers
- Portfolio tracking and "what‑if" backtesting
- Role‑based dashboards for investor / risk / research personas
- Cloud deployment (Render / Azure / AWS) with CI/CD and monitoring
- Multi‑tenant support for multiple users and teams
